Document Version: 1.0
Date: May 30, 2025
Purpose: To outline the standard workflow for processing unmanned aerial system (UAS) / drone data to generate orthomosaics and point clouds using Trimble Business Center, with a focus on projects requiring a local coordinate system.

1.0 Project Setup and Coordinate System Configuration

    1.1 Create New Project
        Launch Trimble Business Center. [cite: 2]
        On the Start Page, click New Project . [cite: 3]
        Select the appropriate project template. [cite: 3]
            If using a custom local system frequently, consider creating a template with this system predefined. [cite: 4]
            Default templates (e.g., "US Survey Foot" or "Metric") can be used as a starting point. [cite: 5]
        Enter a Project Name and define the Project Folder location. [cite: 6]
        Click OK . [cite: 6]

    1.2 Configure Coordinate System (Local System)
        This is a critical step for ensuring survey accuracy and compatibility with local site requirements. [cite: 7]

        1.2.1 If Importing a Pre-defined Local Coordinate System (e.g., from a JXL, DC, CFG, or GlobalFeatures.fxl file):
            Go to the Project Settings (often accessible via the "Home" tab or by right-clicking the project name in Project Explorer). [cite: 8]
            Navigate to the Coordinate System section. [cite: 9]
            Click Change . [cite: 9]
            In the Coordinate System Manager, select Import from File or browse the library if the local system was previously added. [cite: 10]
            For JXL/DC/CFG: Choose the appropriate file type and navigate to your coordinate system definition file. [cite: 11]
            For GlobalFeatures.fxl: Ensure this file is in the correct TBC support folder (C:\ProgramData\Trimble\Trimble Business Center\GeoData) and the system should appear in the library. [cite: 12]
            Verify the imported parameters (Projection, Datum, Geoid Model if applicable, Site Calibration if part of the file). [cite: 13]
            Click Finish and OK . [cite: 14]

        1.2.2 If Defining a New Local Coordinate System Manually (e.g., Assumed Coordinates, Ground Scale):
            Go to Project Settings > Coordinate System . [cite: 14]
            Click Change . [cite: 15]
            In the Coordinate System Manager, you might start with a known system (e.g., a State Plane zone) if your local system is a modification of it, or select "No Projection / No Datum" for a purely local ground system. [cite: 15]
            For a Scaled and Oriented Local System (common method):
                It's often best to establish the local system based on surveyed control points. [cite: 16]
                You will typically perform a Site Calibration after importing your ground control data (see Section 2.2). [cite: 17]
                This process mathematically derives the local system parameters based on the relationship between global (e.g., WGS84 from drone) and local coordinates of your GCPs. [cite: 18]
            Alternatively, if you have known parameters for a projection (e.g., Transverse Mercator) and datum transformation, you can define these manually: [cite: 19]
                Click New to create a new coordinate system definition. [cite: 19]
                Select Projection , Datum (potentially creating a new local datum), and Geoid Model (if elevations are orthometric). [cite: 20]
                Projection: Choose the appropriate type (e.g., Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conformal Conic) and enter all parameters (Origin Latitude/Longitude, Central Meridian, False Northing/Easting, Scale Factor). [cite: 21]
                Datum: If a local datum is needed, define it by specifying the transformation parameters from a known datum (e.g., WGS84 or NAD83) or by defining a new ellipsoid. [cite: 22]
                Geoid Model: Select "No Geoid Model" if working with ellipsoidal heights or if a geoid is not applicable to your local system. [cite: 23]
                Otherwise, select an appropriate model or import one. [cite: 24]
            For an Assumed Coordinate System (No Projection / No Datum):
                Select "No Projection / No Datum." [cite: 24]
                You will typically use a Site Calibration (see Section 2.2) to align the project to your local control, or manually key in coordinates for control points. [cite: 25]
            Give your new coordinate system a descriptive name. [cite: 26]
            Click Finish and OK . [cite: 26]

        Important Note on Local Systems: If your drone data is in WGS84 (typical) and your GCPs are in a local system, a Site Calibration is the most robust way to link them accurately. [cite: 27]
        The following steps assume this common workflow. [cite: 28]

2.0 Data Import

    2.1 Import Ground Control Points (GCPs)
        From the Home tab, click Import (or drag and drop the file into the Plan View). [cite: 28]
        Navigate to your GCP file (e.g., .csv, .txt, .jxl). [cite: 29]
        In the Import dialog:
            Verify the Importer Format (e.g., "Point Easting Northing Elevation Code"). [cite: 29]
            If necessary, create or modify a format to match your file structure. [cite: 30]
            Ensure the Coordinate System is set to your defined Local Coordinate System (from Step 1.2). [cite: 31]
            If the GCPs are in a different system (e.g., WGS84), import them in that system first, then transform or use them for calibration. [cite: 32]
            Best practice is to have GCPs in the final target local system. [cite: 33]
            Check the preview to ensure data is being read correctly. [cite: 34]
        Click Import . [cite: 34]
        Verify the imported points in the Plan View and Project Explorer. Check their coordinates. [cite: 35]

    2.2 Import Drone Imagery (and Trajectories if separate)
        Ensure your drone imagery (JPEGs) contains EXIF metadata with WGS84 coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). [cite: 36]
        Go to the Photogrammetry tab. (If not visible, you may need to enable it via Support > Options > Ribbon, or ensure your TBC license includes the Photogrammetry module). [cite: 37]
        Click Import UAS Data . [cite: 38]
        In the "Import UAS Data" wizard:
            Source Data:
                Click Add and navigate to the folder containing your drone images. [cite: 38]
                Select all images. [cite: 39]
                If you have a precise trajectory file (e.g., from PPK processing), you can add it here. [cite: 39]
                Specify the format and coordinate system of the trajectory file. [cite: 40]
            Camera Information:
                TBC will attempt to read camera information from EXIF data. [cite: 41]
                Verify the Focal Length , Pixel Size , and Principal Point (cx, cy). [cite: 42]
                If TBC does not have your camera in its database, you may need to create a new camera definition or ensure the EXIF data is complete. [cite: 43]
            Photo Stations:
                Review the imported photo stations (camera locations). Their initial positions will be based on the EXIF WGS84 coordinates. [cite: 44]
                Ensure the Coordinate System for the imported photo stations is correctly interpreted (usually WGS84 or the system of the PPK trajectory). [cite: 45]
            Ground Control Points (for initial linking):
                This step allows for initial, rough association if your image tags or a separate file links images to GCPs. [cite: 46]
                For manual GCP measurement (more common for high accuracy), you can often skip direct import here and measure in the next steps. [cite: 47]
            Click Import . TBC will process the images and display the photo stations. [cite: 48]

3.0 Ground Control Point Measurement and Linking

    3.1 Access Adjust Photo Stations Command
        On the Photogrammetry tab, in the "Adjustment" group, click Adjust Photo Stations . [cite: 49]
        This opens the UAS Adjustment Report and allows for GCP measurement. [cite: 50]
        Alternatively, you can start by creating a New Photogrammetry Block and then proceeding to GCP measurement. [cite: 51]

    3.2 Measure GCPs in Images
        In the "Adjust Photo Stations" command view (or the Photogrammetry Editor if using that workflow):
            The left panel will list your imported GCPs (from Step 2.1). [cite: 52]
            The right panel will show images. [cite: 53]
        Select a GCP from the list. [cite: 53]
        TBC will suggest images that likely contain that GCP based on proximity to the photo stations. [cite: 54]
        For each GCP:
            Double-click an image thumbnail to open it in the measurement view. [cite: 55]
            Zoom in to the GCP target. [cite: 55]
            Carefully click the center of the GCP target in the image. TBC will place a marker. [cite: 56]
            Repeat this for at least 3-5 images per GCP, ensuring good geometric distribution (images from different angles and positions). [cite: 57]
            More images are better, especially for check points. [cite: 58]
        Use the arrow keys or image selection tools to move to other relevant images for the selected GCP. [cite: 58]
        Ensure you are marking the exact same feature on the ground in each photo. [cite: 59]
        Designate GCPs:
            For each GCP, in the GCP properties (often in the table below the image view or by right-clicking the GCP), set its Usage type: [cite: 60]
                Control (XYZ): Used in the adjustment for all three coordinates. [cite: 61]
                Control (XY): Used in the adjustment for horizontal position only. [cite: 62]
                Control (Z): Used in the adjustment for vertical position only. [cite: 63]
                Check Point: Not used in the adjustment calculation but used to verify its accuracy. [cite: 63]
                It is crucial to have independent check points. [cite: 64]
        Repeat for all GCPs and Check Points. [cite: 65]

    3.3 Review and Refine Measurements
        After measuring all GCPs, review the measurements. [cite: 65]
        Look for: [cite: 66]
            Large residuals (if an initial adjustment has been run). [cite: 66]
            Inconsistent marking. [cite: 66]
            Points marked in too few images. [cite: 66]
        Adjust or add measurements as necessary. [cite: 67]

4.0 Photogrammetric Adjustment (Bundle Adjustment)

    4.1 Perform Site Calibration (If Local System is Being Derived)
        If you started with "No Projection / No Datum" or need to refine the transformation between WGS84 (drone) and your local GCPs:
            Ensure your GCPs have both WGS84 (from initial photo station estimates near them) and Local Coordinates (from your survey import). [cite: 67]
            In Project Settings > Coordinate System , or via the Survey tab, find the Site Calibration command. [cite: 68]
            Add your GCPs as control points, matching their WGS84 (often labeled as "Global") and Local coordinates. [cite: 69]
        Review the calibration residuals. [cite: 69]
        Adjust point pairings or disable problematic points if necessary. [cite: 70]
        Once satisfied, Apply the calibration. [cite: 70]
        This mathematically defines the relationship and transformation for your local system. [cite: 71]
        Note: The "Adjust Photo Stations" command also incorporates aspects of this by using the GCPs to tie the WGS84-based imagery to the local system. [cite: 72]
        The dedicated Site Calibration tool offers more detailed control over the coordinate system definition itself. [cite: 73]
        For many drone workflows, the adjustment within the photogrammetry module handles this implicitly if GCPs have local coordinates. [cite: 74]

    4.2 Run Bundle Adjustment
        Within the "Adjust Photo Stations" command/view:
            Review the Adjustment Settings . [cite: 75]
            These may include parameters for camera calibration (self-calibration is common), weighting, and outlier rejection. [cite: 76]
            Default settings are often a good starting point. [cite: 77]
        Ensure the correct GCPs are enabled for control. [cite: 77]
        Click Adjust or Run Adjustment . [cite: 78]
        TBC will perform the bundle adjustment, calculating:
            Precise camera positions and orientations. [cite: 79]
            Optimized camera parameters (if self-calibration is enabled). [cite: 79]
            Coordinates of tie points. [cite: 80]
            Residuals on GCPs and check points. [cite: 80]

    4.3 Review Adjustment Report
        Carefully examine the UAS Adjustment Report :
            Overall RMS Error: Indicates the general fit of the adjustment. [cite: 81]
            GCP Residuals: Crucial for accuracy assessment. Check X, Y, Z residuals for each control point. [cite: 82]
            Investigate any large residuals – they may indicate a bad measurement in an image or an issue with the surveyed GCP coordinate. [cite: 83]
            Check Point Residuals: These provide an independent measure of the accuracy of the final products. [cite: 84]
            Camera Parameters: Note any changes if self-calibration was used. [cite: 85]
            Tie Point Reprojection Error: Indicates how well the automatic tie points fit. [cite: 85]
        If residuals are unacceptable:
            Re-measure problematic GCPs in the images. [cite: 86]
            Disable a suspect GCP and re-run the adjustment. [cite: 87]
            Check the original survey data for the GCPs. [cite: 87]
            Ensure sufficient image overlap and good image quality. [cite: 88]
        Repeat the adjustment until a satisfactory result is achieved. [cite: 88]
        Once satisfied, Apply the adjustment. [cite: 89]
        This updates the photo station positions and orientations. [cite: 89]

5.0 Generate Photogrammetric Products

    5.1 Generate Point Cloud
        On the Photogrammetry tab, in the "Deliverables" group, click Create Point Cloud . [cite: 90]
        In the "Create Point Cloud" dialog:
            Name: Assign a name to the point cloud. [cite: 91]
            Region: Select the area for point cloud generation (e.g., "Entire Block" or define a polygon). [cite: 92]
            Density: Choose the desired point density (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Ultra). Higher density takes longer and creates larger files. [cite: 93]
            Point Cloud Type:
                Dense: Creates a detailed point cloud. [cite: 94]
                Sparse: Creates a less dense cloud, often from the initial tie points (less common for final deliverables). [cite: 94]
            Colorization: Ensure "Colorize Point Cloud" is checked if RGB values are desired. [cite: 95]
            Advanced Settings: Explore options for noise filtering, smoothing, etc., if needed. [cite: 95]
        Click Create . [cite: 96]
        This process can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. [cite: 96]
        Once complete, the point cloud will be added to your project and can be viewed and further processed (e.g., classification, cleaning). [cite: 97]

    5.2 Generate Orthomosaic
        On the Photogrammetry tab, in the "Deliverables" group, click Create Orthomosaic . [cite: 98]
        In the "Create Orthomosaic" dialog:
            Name: Assign a name to the orthomosaic. [cite: 99]
            Ground Sample Distance (GSD) / Pixel Size: Specify the desired resolution for the orthomosaic. [cite: 99]
            This is often related to the original image GSD. [cite: 100]
            Surface:
                From Point Cloud: Select the dense point cloud generated in Step 5.1. [cite: 101]
                This is generally recommended for the best quality digital surface model (DSM) for orthorectification. [cite: 102]
                Alternatively, you can use a pre-existing surface or generate one on the fly, but using the photogrammetrically derived point cloud is typical. [cite: 103]
            Region: Define the area for orthomosaic generation. [cite: 103]
            Output Format: Choose the desired file type (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG). [cite: 104]
            GeoTIFF is recommended for geospatial use. [cite: 104]
            Advanced Settings:
                Blending Method: Options like "Radiometric Balancing" can improve visual consistency. [cite: 105]
                Compression: Select if needed. [cite: 105]
                Tiling: For large areas, consider tiling the orthomosaic. [cite: 105]
        Click Create . [cite: 106]
        This process is also computationally intensive. [cite: 106]
        The orthomosaic will be added to your project. [cite: 107]

6.0 Quality Control (QC) and Export

    6.1 Visual Inspection
        Point Cloud:
            Check for noise, gaps, and overall completeness. [cite: 107]
            Verify that features are well-defined. [cite: 108]
            Use limit boxes or section views to inspect specific areas. [cite: 109]
        Orthomosaic:
            Check for visual artifacts (e.g., smearing, ghosting, building lean if using a DSM). [cite: 109]
            Verify color balance and consistency. [cite: 110]
            Overlay design data or existing linework to check for positional accuracy. [cite: 111]

    6.2 Accuracy Assessment
        Use the residuals on Check Points from the adjustment report as the primary indicator of accuracy. [cite: 112]
        If further checks are needed, you can:
            Take independent field measurements and compare them to the point cloud or orthomosaic. [cite: 113]
            Use TBC's measurement tools to check distances and elevations between known points. [cite: 114]

    6.3 Export Data
        Point Cloud:
            Right-click the point cloud in Project Explorer. [cite: 114]
            Select Export . [cite: 115]
            Choose a suitable format (e.g., LAS, LAZ, E57, RCP). [cite: 115]
        Orthomosaic:
            The orthomosaic is typically saved directly to the specified output location during generation. [cite: 116]
            If you need to export it again or in a different format:
                Select the orthomosaic. [cite: 117]
                Look for export options, often in the "Home" tab or by right-clicking. [cite: 117]
        Project Report:
            Generate a project report that includes the adjustment summary, GCP residuals, and processing parameters for documentation. [cite: 119]
            (File > Reports or specific reporting tools). [cite: 119]

7.0 Data Management and Archiving
    Save the TBC project (.vce file). [cite: 120]
    Archive all raw data (images, GCP survey data), the TBC project, and final deliverables in an organized manner. [cite: 121]
    Document any deviations from this SOP and the reasons for them. [cite: 121]
